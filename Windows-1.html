<h3 class="font-monospace text-success">Features of Windows 1.0</h3>

<h5 class="font-roboto text-dark">
<ul>
<li>Windows 1.0 was built on the MS-DOS kernel, while it runs as a 16-bit shell program known as the MS-DOS Executive, and it offers limited multitasking of existing MS-DOS programs and concentrates on creating an interaction paradigm, an execution model and a stable API for native programs for the future.
</li>
</br>
<li>
The operating environment supports the use of a mouse, which allows users to perform click-and-drag operations. Contrary to modern Windows operating systems, the mouse button had to be kept pressed to display the selected menu.
</li>
</br>
<li>
Windows 1.0 also includes programs such as the Calculator, Paint (then known as Paintbrush), Notepad, Write, Terminal, and Clock. Paint only supports monochrome graphics.
</li>
</br>
<li>
 Puzzle and Chess were supposed to appear as playable video games, although Microsoft scrapped the idea; instead, it introduced Reversi as a commercially published video game. It was included in Windows 1.0 as a built-in application, and it relies on mouse control.
</li>
